# 7. Module 3 Exercises

The concepts in this module are best understood by working directly with the software. These exercises will guide you through using Isaac Sim and the Isaac ROS GEMs. You will need a computer with a compatible NVIDIA GPU and a full installation of Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS.

## Exercise 1: Your First Isaac Sim Scene

**Goal**: Get familiar with the Isaac Sim interface by creating a simple scene with Python scripting.

1.  Launch Isaac Sim.
2.  From the menu, go to `Window > Script Editor`. This is where you can write and run Python scripts to control the simulation.
3.  Following the example from Chapter 2, write a script that:
    - Creates a `World`.
    - Adds a ground plane using `my_world.scene.add_default_ground_plane()`.
    - Adds three different objects (e.g., a cube, a sphere, and a cylinder) at different positions. You can find available objects in the `omni.isaac.core.objects` module.
    - Assigns a different color to each object.
4.  Run the script by pressing the "Run" button in the Script Editor.
5.  **Verify**: You should see your ground plane and your three colored objects appear in the Viewport. Use the mouse controls to navigate around your scene.

## Exercise 2: Running the VSLAM Pipeline

**Goal**: Run the Isaac ROS Visual SLAM container and see it in action using pre-recorded data.

NVIDIA provides Docker containers with Isaac ROS pre-installed, along with sample data. This is the easiest way to get started.

1.  Follow the official Isaac ROS documentation to set up Docker on your system.
2.  Pull and run the `isaac_ros_visual_slam` Docker container.
3.  Inside the container, download the sample ROSBag file recommended in the documentation. A ROSBag is a file that records all the messages on a set of ROS topics, allowing you to "replay" a previous run.
4.  Launch the `isaac_ros_visual_slam` launch file provided in the container.
5.  In a second terminal attached to the container, play the downloaded ROSBag file using `ros2 bag play <bag_file_name>`.
6.  In a third terminal, start RViz (`rviz2`).
7.  **Verify**: In RViz, add the `/tf` topic. You should see the coordinate frames moving as the VSLAM node estimates the camera's trajectory. Add the Point Cloud2 topic for the SLAM map to see the 3D map being built in real-time.

## Exercise 3: Depth to Laser Scan

**Goal**: Use the `isaac_ros_depth_image_proc` GEM to convert a depth image into a 2D laser scan.

1.  This exercise also uses the Isaac ROS Docker container.
2.  Find a ROSBag file that contains a depth image topic (e.g., `/camera/depth/image_raw`). The Isaac ROS documentation provides links to sample data.
3.  Create a simple ROS 2 launch file that starts the `point_cloud_to_scan_node` from the `isaac_ros_depth_image_proc` package. You will need to remap its input topic to the depth image topic in your bag file.
4.  Run your launch file.
5.  Play the ROSBag file.
6.  Use `ros2 topic echo /scan` to view the `LaserScan` messages being published by the node.
7.  **Verify**: Open RViz and add the `/scan` topic. You should see a 2D laser scan being visualized, representing a slice of the 3D world captured by the depth camera.

## Exercise 4 (Advanced): Navigate with Nav2 in Isaac Sim

**Goal**: Integrate the full perception and navigation stack to make a robot autonomously navigate in Isaac Sim.

This is a challenging but incredibly rewarding exercise that ties the whole module together.

1.  Start with one of the example scenes in Isaac Sim that includes a robot with the necessary sensors and `ros2_control` setup (e.g., the Carter v2 robot).
2.  Create a master ROS 2 launch file that:
    - Launches the Isaac ROS VSLAM node (`isaac_ros_visual_slam`).
    - Launches the Isaac ROS depth processing node (`isaac_ros_depth_image_proc`) to generate the `/scan` topic.
    - Launches the entire Nav2 stack (`nav2_bringup`). You will need to provide it with a configuration file that tells it which topics to use for odometry, TF, and the laser scan.
3.  Launch your master file. This will start dozens of nodes.
4.  Open RViz. You should see the map being created by the VSLAM system and the costmaps being generated by Nav2.
5.  Use the "2D Goal Pose" button in the RViz toolbar to give the robot a navigation goal.
6.  **Verify**: The robot in Isaac Sim should begin moving, planning a path around obstacles, and navigating to the goal you specified. You have successfully built a complete, AI-powered autonomous navigation system.

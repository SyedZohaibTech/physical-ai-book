# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Academic Standard
The content must be technically accurate, rigorous, and follow an academic, pedagogical structure suitable for a university-level course.

### Docusaurus Integrity
<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->
The output must strictly adhere to Docusaurus's file structure and Markdown/MDX syntax, including correct sidebar configuration and linking.

### Illustrative Code
<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
All core technical concepts (ROS 2 communication, URDF structure) must be illustrated with complete and correct Python or XML code examples within code blocks.

### Completeness
<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
The book must cover all 13 weeks of the course, from foundational ROS 2 to the final Capstone Project on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.



## Additional Constraints
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

TODO(ADDITIONAL_CONSTRAINTS): Define any additional constraints or requirements for the project.

## Development Workflow
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

TODO(DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW): Document the development workflow, review process, and quality gates.

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

This constitution outlines the fundamental principles and guidelines governing the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook" project. It supersedes all other conflicting practices or documents. Amendments to this constitution require a formal documentation process, approval from relevant stakeholders, and a clear migration plan for any affected components. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles.

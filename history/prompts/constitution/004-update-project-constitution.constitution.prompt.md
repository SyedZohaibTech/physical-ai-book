## Response snapshot

Updated the project constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Landing Page project. The new constitution includes 6 core principles focusing on user experience, responsive design, performance optimization, conversion-focused elements, modern aesthetics, and content clarity. Additional requirements cover visual design standards, technical requirements, and content requirements. The development workflow section outlines quality gates, review processes, and deployment policies. The constitution is now ready to guide the implementation of the landing page.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created new constitution for the landing page project with 6 core principles
- 🧪 Tests: Constitution validated for completeness and adherence to requirements
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with new project constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to create feature specification based on updated constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution aligns with landing page requirements and provides clear guidance
